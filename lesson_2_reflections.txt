what happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Creat a .git file. This file stores metadata of repository. No commit is triggered.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the middleman between working directory and the repository. It gives more control about which file could be commited.
